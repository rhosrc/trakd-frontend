## Getting Started/User Stories

Welcome to TrakIt! Click the link to get started. (https://trakit.netlify.app/)

To begin, login with your Google Credentials. You will then be able to add your first project by clicking the link! Once you've fill out the form and add your details, you will be able to change them later by visiting your project page and selecting "Edit this project." 

Your dashboard displays a summary of your projects' key details.

You can also add notes to your project!

## Stretch Goals

- I would like to revise the CSS and make it more mobile-friendly.
- I'd like to create a gallery for multiple concept images.
- Styling ternaries to display details more easily.
- Timestamps for notes display/rearranging.
